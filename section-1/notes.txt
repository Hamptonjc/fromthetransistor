======= Transistors =======

- Transistors are small electronic components with two main functions:
	
	- Switch circuits on and off
	- Amplify signals

- Uses a "semiconductor" like silicon to create an electron-emitting N-type &
  electron-absorbing P-type.

- arranged in 3 alternating layers i.e. (N-TYPE | P-TYPE | N-TYPE) with a pin
  at each layer.

- The 3 pins: E, B, C
	- Emitter
	- Base
	- Collector

Incoming Voltage -> Collector -> (N-TYPE | P-TYPE | N-TYPE) -> Emitter -> Outgoing Voltage
					     ^
					    Base
					     ^
				       Control Voltage


- can act as switch:
	- no voltage applied to base -> no voltage flow from collector to
	  emitter

	- A voltage above a certain threshold -> voltage flow.


- The "switch" functionality of a transistor allows for "boolean logic" ->
  True/False -> 1's & 0's

- Operations are done with "logic gates"

- Some basic logic gates: AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR....

- These basic ones take in two inputs and produce one output.

- AND-gate example: Only outputs true if both inputs are true -> both inputs
  are 1 -> both voltages are "high" (as opposed to "low voltages")

- logic gates can be combined to do operations such as addition, subtraction, etc.


========= FPGAs ===========

- Field Programmable Gated Arrays

- Chips that can be reprogrammed as needed

- Based around a Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs)

- CLBs are made up of thousands to millions of transitors.

- Configurable Logic Blocks made up of LUTs, FlipFlops, & Multiplexers

========== LUTs =============

- Programmed by the designer to perform boolean algebra

- example: if LUT has 3 inputs, it can implement any 3 input logic gate

======== Flip-Flop ========
