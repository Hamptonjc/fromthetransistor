======= Transistors =======

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhNyURBiJcU&t=200s

- Transistors are small electronic components with two main functions:
	
	- Switch circuits on and off
	- Amplify signals

- Uses a "semiconductor" like silicon to create an electron-emitting N-type &
  electron-absorbing P-type.

- arranged in 3 alternating layers i.e. (N-TYPE | P-TYPE | N-TYPE) with a pin
  at each layer.

- The 3 pins: E, B, C
	- Emitter: Connected to N-Type
	- Base: Connected to P-Type
	- Collector: Connected to N-Type

- can act as switch:
	- no voltage applied to base -> no voltage flow from collector to
	  emitter
	- A voltage above a certain threshold -> voltage flow.


- The "switch" functionality of a transistor allows for "boolean logic" ->
  True/False -> 1's & 0's

- Operations are done with "logic gates"

- Some basic logic gates: AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR....

- These basic ones take in two inputs and produce one output.

- AND-gate example: Only outputs true if both inputs are true -> both inputs
  are 1 -> both voltages are "high" (as opposed to "low voltages")

- logic gates can be combined to do operations such as addition, subtraction, etc.


========= FPGAs ===========

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfmlsDW3Z4c&t=352s

- Field Programmable Gated Arrays

- Chips that can be reprogrammed as needed

- Based around a Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs)

- CLBs are made up of thousands to millions of transitors.

- Configurable Logic Blocks made up of LUTs, FlipFlops, & Multiplexers

	========== LUTs =============

	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Usoo2j2TQio

	- Programmed by the designer to perform boolean algebra

	- example: if LUT has 3 inputs, it can implement any 3 input logic gate

	======== Flip-Flop ========

	- Clock:
		- "Heartbeat of fpga"
		- Is a square wave, oscillates between 1 & 0 (High & Low)
		- Speed denoted in hertz:
				- 1 MHz -> 1 million "cycles" per second
		- Clock drives the flip flops

	- flip flops have 2 inputs: Data in & clock
		- Data in: 1-bit stream, either 1 or 0

	- flip flops have 1 output

	- Flip flops allow for the storage of state

	======== Multiplexers ========

	- Simply put, it is a "data selector"

	*** Note ***
	- Definitely a lot more stuff about FPGAs, check out nandland.com for more


======== Integrated Circuits (ICs) =========

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igVtLuqmxyM

- ICs take components like transistors, and "integrate" them into circuits on
	a single chip.
	(hints the name)

- There are Analog ICs and Digital ICs

- Digital IC examples: logic gates, flipflops, shift registers, counters,
	memories, & processors

- we've already heard about logic gates & flip flops....

- Memory ICs: RAM & ROM
	- RAM (random access memory) -> Read & Write
	- ROM (Read only memory) -> Read Only, programmed at factory
	- Also EPROM: ROM that can be reprogrammed

- Mixed signal ICs (analog & digital)
	- There are converters to convert signals between analog and digital
	
	- ICUs -> Microcontrollers:
		- chip that has all elements of computer: CPU, RAM, ROM, Clock, I/O etc.

*** Note ***
- Again, a lot more on ICs, but the key takeaway is that just as FPGAs, ICs are made up of transistors.
